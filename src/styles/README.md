# CSS Structure

This folder contains modular CSS files for the Habit Tracker app. Each file covers a specific part of the UI:

- `base.css`: Reset and base styles (typography, body, backgrounds)
- `layout.css`: Container and layout utilities
- `header.css`: Header and title styles
- `navigation.css`: Navigation bar and buttons
- `section.css`: Main content sections
- `index.css`: Imports all the above for easy inclusion

Add more files as needed for forms, calendar, charts, etc.

**Usage:**
Import only `index.css` in your HTML or main JS file to include all styles.
